  ## Description
  I wanted to create a database to help me keep track of my inventory for my ecommerce business. Using the correct technology I can see all of mu products, categories of products, as well as the tags that are associated to those products. I can also see individual products, create new ones, update existing products, as well delete them. I can accomplish those same tasks on the tags as well as the categories. This database will help maintain any ecommerce store.

  ## Installation
  Once the user clones the code, they only need to download the node modules running the npm i command, create the database using the schema, seed the database using the npm run seed comand, then run the server using the npm run watch command. Utilizing an application like Insomnia will help the user to visualize how the database stores, reads, creates, updates and deletes the data.
